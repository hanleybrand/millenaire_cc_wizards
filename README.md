# millenaire_cc_wizards
A custom non-historical/fantasy wizard culture for the Minecraft mod Millenaire

WIP - not done - only install if you're curious and use a temp savegame

The mod folder at the root of the repo contains files that should be copied to your own millenaire-custom/mods folder.

Check out my idea for adding mod support -- besically a faux culture that's just a blocklist, and itemlist and maybe a demo lone building. 

  Currently working-ish is: 
  * _rustic ([Rustic Mod](https://github.com/the-realest-stu/Rustic/wiki))
      * blocklist.txt and itemlist.txt seem pretty solid, with a few cosmetic problems
          * beehives,candles (and possibly lanterns)  sometimes break on placement
      * goals are still a work-in-progress
          * villagers will not perform rustic planting tasks (e.g.  goal=plantchamomile)
          * villagers will not perform rustic planting tasks (e.g.  goal=harvestchamomile)
          * villagers **will** perform rustic gather tasks (e.g. villagers a tag collect the tagged item)
  
  Currently being worked on:
  * _floocraft ([FLoocraft](https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/floocraft)
  * wizards (my actual Mill√©naire mod)
      * WIP village gen is actually pretty cool already
      * the Wizards wear robes etc from ebwizardry
      * they mostly just walk around and chat
      * they can't do magic :expressionless: - looking into it

### TODOS

- [ ] Seperate ebwizardry blocks/items into own \_ebwizardry mod 

- [ ] Get \_rustic goals working (planting, harvesting, crafting) - supporting all crops may not be possible

- [ ] Add core wizards/quests

- [ ] evaluate attractiveness of \_rustic/quests and/or \_ebwizardry/quests 

- [ ] Add support for additional mod: Twiight forest
