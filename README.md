# millenaire_cc_wizards
A custom non-historical/fantasy wizard culture for the Minecraft mod Millenaire

WIP - not done - only install if you're curious and use a temp savegame

The mod folder at the root of the repo contains files that should be copied to your own millenaire-custom/mods folder.

Check out my idea for adding mod support -- besically a faux culture that's just a blocklist, and itemlist and maybe a demo lone building. 

  Currently working is: 
  * _rustic ([Rustic Mod](https://github.com/the-realest-stu/Rustic/wiki))
  
  Currently being worked on:
  * _floocraft ([FLoocraft](https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/floocraft)
  * wizards (my actual Mill√©naire mod)
